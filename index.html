  <!-- Intro -->
  <div class="full-width section-intro">
    <div class="container">
      <p>Boston’s Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) operates the 4th busiest subway system in the U.S. after New York, Washington, and Chicago.  If you live in or around the city you have probably ridden on it.  You may remember subway rides that were slow, cars that were crowded, or everything going smoothly.  When you get off the train, however, you lose sight of the subway until you need to ride it again.  It’s hard to know if you left at a different time if the trains would be less crowded or what the experience is like on the other side of the system.</p>
      <p>The MBTA publishes a substantial amount of subway data.  They provide the full schedule in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format which powers Google’s transit directions.  They also publish realtime train locations for the Red, Orange, and Blue lines (but not Green or Silver).  We captured this realtime data for the entire month of February, 2014.  Also, working with the MBTA, we were able to acquire per-minute entry and exit counts at each station measured at the turnstiles used for payment.</p>
      <p>We attempt to present this information to help people in Boston better understand the trains, how people use the trains, and how the people and trains interact with each other.</p>

  <!-- The Trains -->

      <h2>The Trains</h2>

      <p>In a typical weekday, trains make approximately 1150 trips on the red, orange, and blue lines starting at 5AM and continuing through 1AM the next morning.  On Saturdays trains make 870 trips and on Sundays they make 760.</p>

      <div class="table-inset">

      <p>To better understand how the trains operate, we show all trips that trains took on the red, orange, and blue lines on a single day, Monday February 3 2014.  Each vertical line represents a station, and time extends from top to bottom.  Steeper lines indicate slower trains.  This visualization was first used by Étienne-Jules Marey to visualize train schedules and is typically called a “Marey Diagram.”</p>

      <h2>The People</h2>
      <p>In a typical weekday, 425,000 people enter a station along the red, orange, or blue lines.  On weekends and holidays, that number drops to 200,000.  The busiest day was Friday February 7 when 470,187 people entered the system.</p>

        and
        <a href="#" class="dim" data-dim="entrances">exits</a>
        for the red, orange, and blue line for every hour over the entire month based on records from turnstiles at each station.  Each row represents one week. You can see weekends and weekdays with daily peaks at rush hour, as well as

        and

        Our exit data is less reliable since not all stations measure require that people exit through a turnstile.</p>

      <p>When looking entries an exits broken down by station, you can see the busiest stations are all along the Red Line.  Harvard topped the list, followed close by South Station, and then Downtown Crossing.  The graphic below shows average entries per day all stations.</p>

      <h2>How People and Trains Affect Each Other</h2>
      <p>When you look back at the Marey diagram, the slope of each line tells you how fast a train is going and the time it takes to get between stations.  When all of the start and stop times are lined up you can see a drastic variation in the time it takes to get between stops throughout the day.  If you have ever ridden the subway during rush hour then you have experienced what the steep lines in the Marey diagram feel like first-hand.</p>
      <p>What causes these delays?  It’s hard to know for sure, but what we can determine is that delays usually happen when more people are riding the subway.</p>

  <!-- The Conclusion -->
  <div class="full-width section-conclusion">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Through publicly available data, we have the tools to understand the subway system better than we ever have before.  We have seen how the system operates on a daily basis, how people use the system and how that affects the trains.  To see how this affects you on a daily basis, you can take these insights with you whenever you ride the train.  Bookmark <a href="https://mbta.meteor.com" target="_blank">mbta.meteor.com</a> on your mobile phone phone and you can check it any time to see up-to-the-minute congestion and delay.</p>
